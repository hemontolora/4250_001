E00389050:Present 2022-09-27 - I think what you are most interested in is to see that we demonstrate understanding of the software lifecycle and project management principles.

E00314278:It is about the journey more than the destination. You want us to learn how to walk through the steps of software development with a team. You arenâ€™t looking for a complete project.

E00531044:Present 9/27/2022, I believe you are more interested in how we came to the decision we came to and why, and less about a working solution.

E00439739<-In the day of our lord 09/27/2022
- I believe the instructor is looking to see students show improvement and understanding on the software development process (or the topic specifically presented in class)

E00553255:present 9/27/2022

E00554933:9/27/2022-  Employers are looking for hardworking, self-starters, that can learn quickly and want to succeed.

E00575142: 9/27/22
- You are most interested in the methods we used to design and complete the project and why we choose them. 

E00577513:9/27/2022

E00575735:Present 9/27/22 For the semester project, building a complete iteration would be a nice bonus, but the best outcome is for us to collaborate and communicate effectively to simulate a real agile/development team, demonstrating our learning and comprehension of concepts discussed in class.

E00610228: Students displaying learning objectives, implementing feedback, asking questions, and most importantly not the completion of the whole project but how students collaborate and go about solving the problem. 

E00611743: 9/22/2022

E00612013:What the professor is most interested in when it comes to the project is how we apply the topics covered in class and is less focused on a finished product.

E00613440: I believe that what you want to get out of this project is not necisarily a perfect working product as you said yourself that it would take many semesters of students to complete. Rather show the processes that we have been going over in class to create a good product.

E00615612: 09/27/22; You are most interested in us applying knowledge and gaining experience with SCRUM. You aren't as interested in us conpletely finishing. (10/18/2022)

E00617064:Present 9/27/2022 You are most interested with us learning how to properly work in groups and follow the software engineering model, not a complete and functional final product. 

E00619309:Present September Twenty Seventh, Twenty Twenty Two 
Kinser wants:
to give us a hands-on experience in the design and implementation of a software system.
us learn to communicate how we have made progress each week.
Everyone to do their best and show that we have made as much progress as we can
Develop our SWECOM skills

E00619428: 9/27/22 - That we understand the concepts taught to us in class, and know how to apply them.

E00658861: How much effort we put into the project.

E00670928:Present 09/27/2022

E00612253: I think you are most interested in seeing if we can apply what we have learned to a "real life" scenario while working on this project.

E00733560 Use the knowlage we got on all our classes and use Scrum development methodology.

E00668656: 09/27/2022

E00593300:Present 9/27/2022: I believe that you are most interested in having us gain some form of experience working in a "real life scenario". Working in organized teams that are using a real world development strategy to push a deliverable.

E00614238: Your goal is to trick us into learning the material by making the project secretly put us through everything we have done this semester.

E00520999: Present 09/27/2022 - I think what you are looking for is student compatibility working with others over code, implementation of new ideas, and exceeding expectations.

E00524977: How the server is going to communicate with the clients

E00574144:9/27/2022

E00569128 10/18/2022 - getting a hands on experience using design and implementation. also, to utilize proper practice as a software engineer


I believe Kinser is interested in how well we apply the concepts/learning objectives in each sprint. He will also be interested in seeing working software,
as this is software engineering, but I think he will be most interested in the previous statement. In each class exercise, Kinser has looked not at the completion,
but at the process and how well we understood the topic.
